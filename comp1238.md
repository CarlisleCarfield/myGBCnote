## Week 1 - History
Babylonian Numerals:
System using two types of wedges, one means 10 the other means 1.
Numbers up to 59 are jsut sum of the two types wedges.
Then positional base-60 system similar to modern base-10.
Other Systems:

Egyptian: Symbols for powers of 10.
Roman: Subtractive notation (e.g., MCM = 1900)


## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
Binary System
Bit: Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).
Byte: Group of 8 bits.
Binary Numbers: Numbers represented using base 2.
Memory Types
Volatile Memory: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM).
Non-Volatile Memory: Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD).
Number Representation
Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.
Signed Numbers: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.
Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.
Text Representation
ASCII Table: Maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 for 'A').
Control Codes: Non-printable characters for control functions (e.g., newline).
File Types
Text Files: Interpreted as characters using ASCII.
Binary Files: Not intended to be read as text.
Historical Context
Morse Code: Early binary communication using short and long beeps.
Punch Cards: Early data storage method using holes to represent bits.
Teleprinters: Early devices for sending typed messages over long distances.
Additional Topics
Number Systems
Decimal (Base 10): Standard human number system.
Binary (Base 2): Used in computing.
Hexadecimal (Base 16): Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F.
Conversion Examples
Binary to Decimal: Sum powers of 2 for each '1' bit.
Hexadecimal to Decimal: Sum powers of 16 for each digit.
Memory and Storage
RAM: Fast, volatile memory for active processes.
Storage Devices: Include SSDs and HDDs, used for long-term data storage.
Practical Applications
Text Editors: Display bytes as characters using ASCII.
File Structure: Files are sequences of bytes, organized in directories.
Study Tips
Understand the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory.
Practice converting between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.
Familiarize yourself with ASCII and its role in text representation.
Explore how files are structured and the difference between text and binary files.


##Week03-Text-Structure.md
Text Structure
Historical Context:
Early text structures in printing and typewriting.
Example: Ancient texts with commentary.
Modern Examples:
Newspapers, ledgers, and digital formats like JSON.
Key Concepts
Lines and Indentation:
Lines are fundamental in coding.
Indentation helps in visual understanding.
Paragraphs:
Important in HTML for text presentation.
Markup Languages
Markdown:

Simple syntax for formatting.
Titles: # Title, ## Subtitle
Italic: _italic_
Bold: **bold**
Lists: * item or - item
Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.
HTML:

More verbose than Markdown.
Tags: <ul>, <li>, <p>, <strong>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>
Special Characters and Escaping
Special Characters:

Non-alphanumeric symbols like @, #, $, &, *.
Escape sequences prevent special interpretation.
Example: \# to display # in Markdown.
HTML Escaping:

Use &lt; for <, &gt; for >, &amp; for &.
Structured Data
JSON:

Format: {"key": "value"}
Human-readable and widely used for data interchange.
XML:

Similar to HTML, used for data representation.
Tags: <tag>value</tag>
Tools and Platforms
GitHub:
Platform for version control and collaboration.
Markdown is used for documentation (README.md).
Create accounts with personal emails for longevity.
Unicode
Similar to ASCII - assigns numbers to characters, but allows for much larger numbers and therefore more characters.
While in ASCII the numbers are called "ASCII codes", in unicode the name used is "Unicode codepoints"
In contrast to ASCII there are multiple different ways of converting the codepoints into a binary representation:
UTF-32 simply uses 4 bytes to store the codepoint number of in binary, but this wastes a lot of space because most bytes end up being filled with zeroes.
UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for all the basic characters but uses multiple bytes for codepoints above 127. UTF-8 is by far the most popular encoding on the internet.
Unicode codepoints are usually written as hex number with prefix U+ for example U+21AA is the codepoint for this character: â†ª
Note that the binary representation for this codepoint will be different depending on which encoding is used, but in most cases we use UTF-8.
Additional Notes
Browsers:

Complex software handling HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Different rendering engines: Blink (Chrome, Edge), WebKit (Safari).
Lab Exercise:

Practice editing Markdown on GitHub.
Submit screenshots of rendered Markdown.
Study Tips
Familiarize with Markdown and HTML syntax.
Practice using escape characters in different contexts.
Explore GitHub for hands-on experience with repositories and Markdown files.


##Lecture 4: Manipulating Text & Text Editors
Keyboard Mastery
Importance: Efficient typing reduces cognitive load.
Types:

QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak.
Modifier Keys: modify the behavior of other keys - Control, Shift, Alt etc.
Touch Typing: Encouraged for efficiency and reduced fatigue.
Text Editors
Types:
Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) vs. Text Editors (e.g., Notepad).
Popular Editors:
Vim: Command-line based, requires learning commands.
